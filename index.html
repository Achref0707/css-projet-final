          I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very
          enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine. My
          friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good
          sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me,
          I feel extremely comfortable with them.
